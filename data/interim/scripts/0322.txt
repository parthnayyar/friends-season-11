cailin: ross, i’m gonna go.
ross: go? why?
cailin: i don’t know. could be because i don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
ross: but-but cailin, he definitely will scream.
cailin: good bye ross.
ross: uh, oh-ho bye.
the director: (entering carrying a newspaper) here we go people! (starts reading the review) boxing day! the lucille lortel theatre, blah-la-la-la… ah-ha! joey tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but mr. tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.

the director: kate miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. (kate walks away depressed.) badda-badda-badda. ah-ha! here it is! the direction by marshal talmant is… (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. please, stuff your talentless faces with my mother’s crab cakes!
