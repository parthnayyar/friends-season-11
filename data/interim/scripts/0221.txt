the one with the two bullies
[scene: monica and rachel's apartment. everyone is there. monica is watching stock prices on a business channel.]
joey: hey monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
monica: 'cause i was going by it the other day and i saw that there was a stock with my
initials, meg, on it and, well, sometimes i have to watch for two or three hours before it
comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
rachel: ok honey, you really need a job.
ross: mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
monica: really.
phoebe: ok, right there. that, that's the third sign today. right
there.
ross: on behalf of everyone, i'd just like to say behuh.
phoebe: no, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere i go today i
keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. like when i was walking over here and i
passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
everyone: ahh.
phoebe: and they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. and
there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
monica: his indian name?
phoebe: no because i chickened out the last time when i tried to meet him. so i mean
coincidences? i don't think so.
ross: freakish.
monica: wow.
joey: freaky.
monica: weird, weird.
rachel: ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
phoebe: oh, alright, that's it, now i have to go see him.

through it.] ahhh.
[scene: central perk. chandler and ross are sitting at the couch.]
chandler: hey.

chandler: do you have to be a century 21 real-estate agent to get to
wear those really cool jackets?
ross: do you say this stuff to girls?
big
bully: hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
little
bully: and look where they're sitting.
ross: you're joking, right? you guys just walked through the door.
big
bully: maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
little
bully: yeah.
big
bully: this couch belongs to us.
chandler: alright, i'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call
the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
big
bully: you know what i keep wondering? why you two are still sitting here.
ross: alright, that's it. i've had enough of this, alright. gunther,
these guys are trying to take our seat.
gunther: fellas, these guys were here first.
big
bully: oh, sorry, i didn't realize.
little
bully: sorry.
gunther: there you go.
ross: thank you gunther. we didn't want to have to go and do that.
little
bully: he told on us?
big
bully: you told on us?
ross: well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's
tie]
chandler: don't play with his things.
ross: i know.
big
bully: alright, let's take this outside.
ross: let's, let's take this outside? who talks like that?
big
bully: the guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
chandler: you had to ask.
ross: yeah.
[the bullies grab the back of the couch that ross and chandler are sitting in and tip
back]
ross: ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight
you guys.
little
bully: well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your
faces in this coffee house ever again.
chandler: i think you played the gunther card too soon.
[scene: back in the cab in front of phoebe's dad's house.]
joey: hey phoeb's, i think you're good to go.
phoebe: yeah, i don't know.
rachel: what's the matter?
phoebe: i just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. i mean, like the beast at
the threshold, you know. it's just like, i have no family left, ya know. i mean except for
my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite
what she says. and i have a sister who i've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.
i don't know, this is my real father and i just, i want things to be like just right.
rachel: yeah phoebe, i completely understand.
joey: yeah, whatever you need. hey, you wanna go home?
phoebe: ok, thanks. sorry, again
[she starts the cab and pulls forward. we hear a squish and a dog yelp.]
phoebe: [innocently] what was that?
joey: uhh, i'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
[scene: monica and rachel's apartment. joey is eating breakfast, rachel has just gotten
up, and monica is on the phone.]
monica: i wanna buy 5 shares of sgj and i wanna buy them now. c'mon
time is money my friend. thank you. wooo.
rachel: time is money my friend?
joey: yeah, you missed, 'takes money to make money,' and uh, 'don't make me come down
there and kick your wall street butt.'
monica: hey, i made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
joey: well uh, i had breakfast here so technically i saved $3.50.
rachel: how did you make $17.
monica: well, my financially challenged friends, i split my money
and i bought some shares of chp and zxy.
joey: how come those?
monica: well, chp because i used to have a crush on eric estrada. and zxy becuase i think
it sounds zexy.
rachel: what happened to uh, meg.?
monica: meg was good for me but i dumped her. ya know, my motto is
get out before they go down.
joey: that is so not my motto.
phoebe: [enters] hey.
rachel: hey phoebs. oh hey, how's the dog?
phoebe: ok, i talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. anyway, he said that the
little fella's gonna be ok and i can pick him up tomorrow.
joey: good.
rachel: oh, thank god.
phoebe: yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he
said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
rachel: ok, so phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is
ok?
phoebe: i, i don't wanna meet my father over the phone. what am i
gonna say, like 'hi, i'm phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. oh, by the way, i broke your
dog.'
joey: hey phoebs, if you want, i'll do it.
phoebe: ok. listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone
that's sitting by monica]
monica: don't...be too long with the phone.
rachel: she'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
joey: [dials the phone] it's a woman.
phoebe: so talk to her.
joey: [in a fake voice] uhh, hello miss buffay. i know where your
dog is. i want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within,
within 24 hours. uh, goodbye.
[hangs up]
rachel: why the voice.
joey: [in the voice] hard to say.
[scene: chandler and joey's apartment. ross is sitting at the bar, chandler serves up
two mugs of hot water.]
chandler: your cappucino sir.
ross: thank you.
[they both pour in packets of cappucino mix]
chandler: ya know i think this is much better than the coffee house.
ross: absolutely.
[they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs]
ross: how come it's not mixing with the water?
chandler:well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. stir and drink,
stir and drink, never let it settle.
[they both try to drink while continuously stirring]
joey: [walks out of his room] hey, this is ridiculous. i'll tell you what. after i get

chandler: alright, hang on a second there custer.
joey: yeah really, ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
ross: yeah, sure.
joey: by someone besides monica?
ross: no. so what. so what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just
something every man has to go through once in his life. ya know, like a, like a right of
passage or somethin'.
chandler: well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? ya know, because i think
actually mine's growing back.

frank: yeah, he loved stilts. one time i was upstairs, i was stealing cigarettes out of my
mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden i look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past
the window. he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always
happiest when he was on his stilts.
phoebe: wow.
frank: yeah.
phoebe: i don't know what to do with that.
frank: me neither. so you're like my big sister.
phoebe: yeah.
frank: this is huge, you can buy me beer.
phoebe: i'm not gonna. but you know what's cool though? ok, if you had a friend named
pete, then i could say, 'oh yeah, i know pete, he's friends with my brother.'
frank: i gotta friend named mark.
phoebe: that'll work too.
frank: cool, alright. so maybe, ya know, i could give you a call sometime, we could talk
or somethin'.
phoebe: yeah, that'd be ok.
frank: alright.
phoebe: ok, i'm in the book.
frank: ok, yeah.
phoebe: alright. so um, stilts huh?
