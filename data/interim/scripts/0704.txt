[scene: monica, chandler, and phoebe's, everyone is there and they are finishing watching the first episode of mac and c.h.e.e.s.e. joey is of course mac.]
mac: (on tv) well, if we learned one thing today c.h.e.e.s.e. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. (cut to joey laughing while rachel, chandler, and monica aren’t amused.)
c.h.e.e.s.e: you can say that again mac.
mac: well, i couldn’t have done it without you buddy. you’re a genius.
c.h.e.e.s.e: oh yeah? well then how come i can’t get my vcr to stop blinking 12:00?
(they both break into a huge laugh and do that stop motion thing they had at the end of chips.)
joey: (laughing and turning off the tv) so, what did you guys think?
(they all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally. finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by monica.)
monica: (on phone) hello? (listens) hold on please. joey, it’s your mom. (hands him the phone.)
chandler: it’s your mommy. it’s your mommy.
ross: ohhhh…
rachel: that’s nice.
joey: (on phone) mom, so what did you think? (he walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)
rachel: well that was umm…okay.
ross: it wasn’t the best.
chandler: that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.
monica: wh-what are we gonna tell him?
ross: well, the lighting was okay.
rachel: ohh no you don’t! you got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
monica: and i have costumes.
ross: oh great! that means i’m stuck with, "so, we were watching you in there (points to the tv) and you were sittin’ right here! whoa!"
(phoebe gets up.)
rachel: what are you gonna do pheebs?
phoebe: i don’t know. i don’t know. i can’t lie to him again. oh no i—no! i’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
chandler: and say nothing?
phoebe: uh-huh, yeah that’s right.
joey: (hangs up the phone) wow! well, my folks really liked it! so what-what did you guys think? (phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) it wasn’t that good.r
[scene: central perk, phoebe and monica are reading on the couch.]
monica: phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
phoebe: what? you mean behind my back?

joey: uh rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
rachel: it’s the same story.
joey: (groans in disgust) wow, it’s really long.

[scene: rachel’s new office, she’s interviewing a potential new assistant, hilda.]
rachel: (reading the resume) and you were at this job for four years?
hilda: that’s right.
rachel: okay, well this is all very impressive hilda, um i just have one last question for you. uh, how did i do? was this okay?
hilda: what?
rachel: i’ve never interviewed anyone before. i’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. although when i was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.
hilda: no dear. it’s not.
rachel: no. yeah, and i know that. all right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
hilda: thank you! good meeting you.
rachel: all right. (hilda exits) i’m a total pro!
(there’s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)
man: hello?
rachel: (seeing him) wow! h-umm! hi! yes, uh i’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.
man: actually, i’m here about the assistant job.
rachel: really?! (taking his resume) okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?
man: tag jones.
rachel: uh-huh, go on.
tag: that’s it. that’s my whole name.
rachel: that’s your whole name, okay of course it is! okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (looking at his resume)
tag: i know i haven’t worked in an office before, and i really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…
rachel: oh come on, what are you talking about? you’ve got three years painting houses. two whole summers at t.g.i. friday’s, come on!
tag: it’s lame, i know. but i’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…
rachel: okay, hold on just a second. (she grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) i’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?
[scene: central perk, chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.]
chandler: no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! (monica shushes him.)
phoebe: (to monica) anyway, i should go. okay, bye.
monica: (to chandler) hey sweetie.
chandler: hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
monica: i can’t tell you. it’s a secret.
chandler: secret? married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
monica: awww. (kisses him.) but still no.
chandler: no i’m serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.
monica: really? okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?
chandler: oh no-no, i can’t do that.
monica: if you tell me, i’ll tell you what phoebe said.
chandler: okay.
monica: okay.
chandler: so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we’re on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.
monica: oh my god. he threw up?
chandler: no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?
monica: oh, nancy thompson from phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
chandler: that’s it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
monica: that’s right! you lose sucker!! (pause) please still marry me.
[scene: monica, chandler, and phoebe's, chandler, rachel, and phoebe are there.]
rachel: chandler, you have an assistant right?
chandler: (angrily) did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
rachel: no, i-i just don’t know how you decide who to hire. i mean i’ve got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
chandler: what about him?
rachel: i love him. he’s so pretty i wanna cry! i don’t know what to do. tell me what to do.
phoebe: come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
rachel: uh-huh. no, i hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing? (takes out his picture.) look how pretty!
phoebe: let’s see. (looking at the picture) oh my god! oh… but no! no! you can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. umm, this is for me (the picture) yes? thanks. (puts it in her pocket.)
rachel: okay you’re right. i’ll hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!
chandler: let me see this guy. (phoebe hands him the picture.) w-h-wow! don’t show this to monica! and don’t tell her about the w-h-wow!
[scene: the days of our lives producer’s office, joey is entering to find terry there.]
terry: hey-hey-hey joey!
joey: hey terry!
terry: good to see you again!
joey: it’s been a while, huh? wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
terry: it’s a different building.
joey: so! stryker remoray huh? when do you want me to start?
terry: why don’t we start right now!
joey: okay.
terry: here are the audition scenes. (holds out the script.)
joey: (looking between the pages and him) audition? i thought you were gonna offer me the part.
terry: why would you think that?
joey: well, i was dr. drake remoray, stryker’s twin brother. i mean, who looks more me than me right?
terry: everybody has to audition.
joey: y’know terry, i-i don’t really need to do this. i got my own cable tv series, (pause) with a robot.
terry: i’m sorry joey that’s…that’s the way it is.
joey: well. i guess you think you’re pretty special huh? sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? well y’know what? (throws the script away) this is one star who’s hoop… this is a star that the hoop—this hoop—i was dr. drake remoray!
[scene: rachel’s office, she’s there as tag knocks on the door and enters carrying a plant.]
rachel: hi! tag. what are you doing here?
tag: i just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. and i noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so i wanted to bring you your first… (notices her plant) there is a plant in your office.
rachel: kinda.
tag: right. so i guess i shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume. (sets the plant down on her desk.)
rachel: oh-ohh, thank you.
tag: anyway, i’m guessing you hired somebody.
rachel: well…
tag: gotcha. thanks again for meeting with me. (starts to leave.)
rachel: but i hired you!
tag: what?
rachel: yeah! you-you got the job! you’re my new assistant!
tag: i am?!
rachel: yeah!
tag: i can’t believe it!
rachel: me either. umm, all right, first thing i need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named hilda and tell her to go home.
[scene: monica, chandler, and phoebe's, monica is setting the table for dinner as chandler enters.]
chandler: hey.
monica: hey! good, you’re home!
chandler: oh it’s always nicer to here than, "aw crap! you again!"
monica: hey baby. (kisses him.)
chandler: hey.
monica: i made you a surprise.
chandler: oh yeah?
monica: yeah, tacos! ever since you told me that story i’ve had such a craving for them.
chandler: did you not understand the story?
ross: (entering) hey!
chandler: hey! what’s up?
monica: ross!
ross: oh, nothin’ much. just trying to figure out what i’m gonna do for dinner.
chandler: huh.

ross: uhh, those are tacos.
monica: excuse me mr. mexico.
ross: eh, either way i’ll pass. (quietly to chandler) i still can’t eat those. (monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) what’s so funny?!
monica: (trying not to laugh) i’m not laughing.
(ross and chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.)
ross: (to chandler) you told her!
chandler: nancy thompson’s getting fired! (monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
ross: (to monica) look, okay-okay i had food poisoning! it’s not like i choose to do it! it’s not like—it’s not like i said, "umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
monica: you’re right. i mean i’m sorry. yeah, i shouldn’t be laughing. i should be laying down papers for you! (runs off laughing which gets chandler laughing.)
ross: (to chandler) how could you tell her?!
chandler: i had too okay?! we’re getting married! married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
ross: oh really? well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city.
chandler: du-ude!
monica: (running up to ross) what happened in atlantic city?!
ross: well, chandler and i are in a bar…
chandler: did you not hear me say, "du-ude?!"
ross: and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay? so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing. now, i know what you’re thinking, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
monica: (to chandler) you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.
chandler: in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.

monica: yeah, definitely!
ross: okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, i-i’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the space mountain story.
