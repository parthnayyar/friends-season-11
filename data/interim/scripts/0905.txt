joey: [its just] so spooky, thats all.
ross: so, so, is mike coming to dinner?
phoebe: no! its my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think its a little to soon to show my true colors.
rachel: pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch emma. (to ross:) which one of us should go to dinner?
phoebe: oh, rachel!
ross: actually, um, i was thinking maybe both of us could go.
phoebe: oh, yay!

rachel: um, mon, chandlers not here.
monica: oh, dear god!r
[scene: tulsa, a conference room. chandler is chairing a group of eight people.]
chandler: good morning everyone, its nice to see our team together for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) yes, ken is it?
ken: thats right. is it true, that the reason you are here in tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
chandler: (laughs) well, dont believe everything you hear, ken. (both turning away to files) but yeah, thats true. alright, lets get started, by take a look at last quarters figures. (the female next to chandler starts smoking, towards her:) ah, claudia, arent you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses ass?
claudia: im sorry. does the smoke bother you?
chandler: no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right now, i cant remember why. (to everyone:) youre not allowed to smoke in this office. not right?
claudia: yes, in oklahoma its legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. (passing the pack) would you like one?
chandler: alright, lolook. i dont smoke anymore. but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, its fine. (everyone lights up) so you all smoke then? thats almost rude, that im not.
ken: thats not true. if you dont wanna smoke
chandler: (loud) ken, please! no, i cant, i cant smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me.
ken: im sorry, but isnt your wife back in new york?
chandler: i always liked you, ken. (takes a cigarette)

rachel: what if she jumped out the bassinet?
ross: cant hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
rachel: oh my god, i left the water running.
ross: rach you did not leave the water running. please, just pull yourself together, okay?
rachel: ah, did i leave the stove on?
ross: you never cooked since 1996. (actually rachel cooked in 609 - tow ross got high, first aired 1999-11-25.)
rachel: is the window open? because if theres a window open, a bird could fly in there.
ross: oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think youre right. i think listen, listen!
rachel: ubb.
ross: a pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared rachel turns away) no, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. landed on the stove and caught fire. the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birds aid. the eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
rachel: boy, are you gonna be sorry if thats true.
[scene: the restaurant with still just phoebe and joey.]
waiter: hello.
phoebe & joey: hey.
waiter: its been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
joey: maybe we should just eat now.
waiter: you cant order until your entire party has arrived. restaurant policy.
joey: wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right? but theres still some food left on their place, okay, whats the restaurants policy about people eatin that?
waiter: estrangement (?).
joey: but it happens? (waiter leaves) im gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe: no, you cant go. no-no-no, i cant hold this table on my own. if they ask me to move, i cave.
joey: if you ask me to stay, ill pee. (leaves)
maitre d: good evening, miss. (phoebe turns her head away) miss? (from the opposite side) miss? (she turns again) miss!
phoebe: okay, fine, ill move. alright, you dont have to manhandle me. (gets up) where? (he points at a smaller table) okay. thank you. wach.

monica: spend more time with the tie. thatll make a baby.
chandler: look, i cant do this. i cant make luv to you while were fighting this way.
monica: oh sure, now youre mister sensitivity. but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncles funeral
chandler: that was a celebration of life. alright, look, im not gonna do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
monica: no, youre right. mnya, we shouldnt do it like this. huch. for what its worth, im, im sorry. i shouldnt have come down on you so hard about the smoking. so you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

ross: great. so lets get going?
rachel: oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, im never leaving her again.
ms. geller: i understand, separation is hard. one time i was about to leave ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: mommy, im a girl, take me with you.
ross: somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.

monica: oh, blablablabaybaybay.
chandler: leave it.
monica: i was just saying that because i was ovulating and you said you wouldnt have sex with me while were fighting.

phoebe: wher-where have you been?

chandler: i would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica: you used to tell girls you were a kennedy. (being sat down) ooh, uh, thanks. wow, little tight, isnt it? how dyou get a bigger table? you-you had a big table, but they made you move. huh-huh, shut up monica. whoo, i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck.
chandler: i suppose that monica will have the manipulative shrew.
waiter: ill give you another minute.
joey: why are you going? he said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)
ross: rach, cmon, emma is fine. youre turning into an obsessive mother. okay, you need to stop.
rachel: yguys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler: you mean the lully story?
ross: (childish) huh-huh, they already know it.
phoebe: you guys, weve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
joey: (returned) no, no, its okay, i already told the waiter what they want.
monica: why would you do that?
joey: chandler, control your woman!
rachel: (lifts for a toast) okay, as everybody has ordered, i would like to start the celebration and make a toast to phoebe. she dropped her sock.
phoebe: aw what?
rachel: n-no, emma dropped her sock.
monica: moms here? i wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
rachel: ross, she still has not noticed that the babys sock is on the ground.
phoebe: s a good toast.
rachel: (to ross) could you please get her attention?
ross: w-oa mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
phoebe: (getting up) oh, for gods sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! (everybody scared) im sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didnt even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) well, its too late now.
ross: well, ??? think thats us?
phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) hello?
joey: (to chandler and monica) well, what is going on with you two?
monica: uch, you see, im ovulating.
chandler: oh yeah, thats what she says. but maybe youre not ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
monica: yes smokie, that is what it was. i just cant get enough.
chandler: (to joey) you not gonna believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
joey: so? did have sex, right?
chandler: whats the matter with me? why im such a girl?
phoebe: (returns) okay, that was mike.
rachel: phoebe, hi, were so sorry. youre totally right. we are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
phoebe: mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, im gonna take off.
