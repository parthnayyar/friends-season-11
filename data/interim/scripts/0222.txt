<EPISODE_START>
the one with the two parties
[scene: moondance diner. ross, phoebe, joey, and chandler are sitting at the counter, monica is working. monica is wearing her costume, including big fake breasts.]
monica: so, i'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's rachel's birthday, i mean, we want it to be special, i thought i'd poach a salmon.
all: ohhh.
monica: what?
ross: question. why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
monica: you wanna be in charge of the food committee?
ross: question two. why do we always have to have parties with committees?
joey: really. why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
ross: yeah.
phoebe: yeah, i agree. ya know, i think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and i'm just not sure we are.
monica: alright. if you guys don't want it to be special, fine. you can throw any kind of party you want.
[joey is staring at monica's breasts]
monica: joey they're not real. i start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. see [squeezes her breast] honk honk.
chandler: wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. opening titles
[scene: central perk. chandler, ross, joey, phoebe, and monica are planning rache's birthday party.]
ross: i talked to rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
monica: ok, um so, i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper.
joey: woah, woah, woah, uh, no shannon cooper.
phoebe: why not her?
joey: cause she uh, she steals stuff.
chandler: or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back.
monica: joey that is horriable.
joey: hey i liked her, alright. maybe, maybe too much. i don't know i guess i just got scared.
phoebe: i'm sorry, i didn't know.
joey: i didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
[rachel enters]
ross: hi honey, how did it go?
rachel: agh, it was the graduation from hell.
chandler: ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
rachel: ya know, i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. my sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. it's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica.
monica: so what happened?
rachel: my parents happened. all they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. but nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them. but you know what, you know what the good news is? i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
phoebe: ok, so i guess we don't invite her parents.
monica: well, how bout just her mom?
chandler: why her mom?
monica: cause i already invited her.
phoebe: ooh, ooh, did you ask stacy roth?
joey: oh no, can't invite her. she also steals.
[scene: monica and rachel's apartment. chandler, joey, monica, and phoebe are setting up for the party.]
phoebe: ok, here are the birthday candles. where's the birthday cake?
monica: ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
chandler: excuse me?
monica: it's a traditional mexican custard dessert.
joey: oh that's nice. happy birthday rachel, here's some goo.
[knock at the door]
monica: [answers the door] dr. greene. oh my god it's rachel's dad. what're you doing here? mr.
greene: what? the father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
monica: no no, the father can, but um, since i am the roommate i can tell you that she's not here and i'll pass along the message, ok. so bye-bye. mr.
greene: ohhh, you're having a parteee.
monica: no, no, not a party. just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows. um, this is phoebe and chandler and joey. mr.
greene: i'll never remember all of that. so uh, what's the deal? rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
chandler: this isn't your first surprise party, is it sir? [knock at the door, monica answers to see mrs. greene] mrs.
greene: hi monica.
[monica slams the door back shut]
monica: chinese menu guy. forgot the menus.
chandler: so, basically just a chinese guy.
joey: uh, hey, dr. greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on rachel's bed. mr.
greene: alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into rachel's bedroom] mrs.
greene: well, my goodness, what was that?
monica: sandra, i am so sorry, i thought you were rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet. mrs.
greene: you thought i was rachel?
chandler: yes because uh, you look so young.
phoebe: and because you're both, you know, white women. mrs.
greene: oh, i missed you kids. well, should i put my coat in the bedroom?
chandler: no! no, i'll take that for ya. mrs.
greene: oh well thank you. such a gentleman. thank you.
[chandler takes the hot pink coat and grimaces at it] ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...
[chandler, remembering that joey and mr. greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard] the funniest thing happened to me on the way here. i was...[joey peeks out]
phoebe:
[cutting mrs. greene off] ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. i can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but i really have to go to the bathroom so... hey, come with me. yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
[they go in the bathroom]
monica: oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
chandler: ok, think, what would jack and chrissy do?
joey: [peeks back out] ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
monica: so uh, joey and chanlder, i, i think it's time that you take dr. greene over to your place.
chandler: uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. why again?
monica: because that's where the party is you goon. see this is just the staging area.
joey: right this is staging.
chandler: yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.

chandler: well, i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
rachel: ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july.
chandler: becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
rachel: it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. but then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. it never occured to anybody to bring another one. and now it's just...
chandler: i, i know.
[hugs her. ross walks out and chandler puts her in his arms.]
[scene: monica's party. she is seeing off the last of the guests.]
monica: ok, thanks for coming, i hope you guys had fun. mrs.

greene:alright, alright, i can get my own coat.
[the guys form a wall between mrs geller and mr geller and dance across the hall as he walks across]

phoebe: oh no, you're not supposed to be here. this is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. mr.
greene: i have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
