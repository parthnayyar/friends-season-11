(scene: central perk. everyone is there.)
monica: tell him.
rachel: no.
phoebe: tell him, tell him.
monica: just...please tell him.
rachel: shut up!
chandler: tell me what?
monica: look at you, you won't even look at him.
chandler: (sarcastically) oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women won't look at me.
rachel: all right, all right, all right. last night, i had a dream that, uh, you and i, were...
phoebe: doing it on this table. (points at the table)
chandler: wow!
joey: exellent dream score.
ross: why, why, why would you dream that?
chandler: more importantly, was i any good?
rachel: well, you were pretty damn good.
chandler: interesting, cause in my dreams, i'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (monica pats him on his lap)
rachel: well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
ross: i love it, when we share.
(ross goes over to the counter. chandler follows him.)
chandler: you're okay there?
ross: i can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
chandler: i'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.r
[scene: central perk, continued from earlier, chandler is sitting on the table.]
chandler: hello rachel.
rachel: get off.
phoebe: (points at joey's pen) uh, uh, gimme. can you see me operating a drill press?
joey: i don't know. what are you wearing?
(chandler, monica and phoebe looks at him)
ross: pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
phoebe: just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.
chandler: pirates again?
phoebe: no, nothing like that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." and they are.
joey: hey, hey, chan. she could work for you.
chandler: (sarcasticly) thanks joey, that's a good idea.
phoebe: what... i could, i could do it. what is it?
chandler: well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. (ross looks at her.) it's a whole big boob story.
phoebe: i could be a secretary.
chandler: well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.
phoebe: i could do that.
(ross's beeper goes off)
rachel: what are you playing with?
ross: oh, it's my new beeper.
joey: what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
monica: is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
ross: no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.
chandler: a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
monica: all right, i'll see you guys later. (raises)
rachel: off to see young ethan?
monica: thank you.
joey: how young is young ethan? young?

monica: windows are clean, candels are lit. uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. did i turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) no, cause i made lasagne. (to rachel) am i out of control?
rachel: just a touch. mon, i don't understand. i mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? i mean, why all the sudden are you so... oh.
monica: what?
rachel: could tonight be the night?

joey: hey, hey. how was the first day?
phoebe: oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.
chandler: see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (joey and ross wonder what he means) me.
phoebe: no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.
chandler: why not?
phoebe: oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
chandler: what?!
phoebe: i thought you knew that.
chandler: noho. who doesn't they like me?
phoebe: everyone. except for uh... no everyone.
chandler: what are you talking about?
phoebe: don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "mr. boss man". you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, "boss man bing".
(joey and ross laughs)
chandler: i can't belive it.
phoebe: yeah, yeah. they even do you.

[scene: monica and rachel's, monica and young ethan are sitting in the couch.]
monica: did not.
young
ethan: i am telling you, up until i was, like nine, i thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
monica: how was that possible?
young
ethan: well, think about it. it's always on the news. 'a man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' and i just kept
thinking: why does people continue to go there? (he checks his watch.) oh, ah. i should go.
monica: okay.
(they kiss)
young
ethan: okay.
monica: unless...
young
ethan: what?
monica: uh, ah. unless you wanna stay over? i mean, i'm going to, so...
young
ethan: yeah, i'd really like that.
(they kiss)
young
ethan: uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
monica: okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'i'm secretly married to a goat?'
young
ethan: well it's somewhere in between. you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not uh..., well i, i mean i haven't ever uh...
monica: ethan?
young
ethan: yeah?
monica: are you a virgin?

young
ethan: yeah. you do know i was talking about you, right?
(they kiss)
[time lapse. they are now in monica's bedroom, on the bed.]
young
ethan: wow!
monica: you keep saying that.
young
ethan: you know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
(they kiss)
monica: listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. and i, i-i figured if you could be honest, then i can to.

(they kiss)
young
ethan: uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, i have another one for you. i'm a little younger than i said.

rachel: where are you going?
phoebe: um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people.
chandler: work people? nobody told me.
phoebe: no, i know. that's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
chandler: you know, i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because i'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.

chandler: then, i don't get it.
phoebe: well, you know what chandler? i think you've gotta face it. you're like, the guy in the big office, you know. you're the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you're a great boss.

ethan: then, what's the problem?
monica: ethan, it's um... it's icky.
young
ethan: icky? you're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
monica: this isn't easy for me either. i wish things were different, i... if you were a few years older, or if i was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, i would really...
young
